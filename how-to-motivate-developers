* Developers are different than other employees - don't treat them the same!
* Motivation comes from more than just money, though you will need to spend more than you probably expect
* Make it an environment they would like to be involved in, not just a work setting
* Developers are in short supply and high demand, so your project must offer something they care about
* Don't micromanage! But attempt to understand different levels of progress. Do this with milestones
* Monetary bonuses can be motivating but only if they are unexpected and baesd off of a strong performance
* Listen, respond and acknowledge their achievements. They're still people, after all
* Protect developers from bureaucracy. Let them develop - that's what they're best at and what they want to do
* Give developers the commander's intent, the overarching theme, and let them run with it. Periodic checks to ensure they're still on the same page
* Assist the developers in continuous learning, whether it be new programming languages or technical proficiencies
