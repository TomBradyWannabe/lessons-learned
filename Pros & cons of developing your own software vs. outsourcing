In-house:
-	Pros: high level of customization, greater control, better ongoing support, aligned interests, high level of commitment
-	Cons: potential for lack of expertise, lack of scalability, expensive and time consuming (at least in the short term)
Outsourcing:
-	Pros: cheap (at least in the short term), quick deployment, smooth integration, access to latest technologies, experience (“lessons learned”) from other customers
-	Cons: high support & maintenance costs, lack of control, potential for lack of confidentiality, conflict of interest
